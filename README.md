# Optimization-for-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithms
This project presents an optimization solution for the classic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The implementation leverages the DEAP library in Python to find efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles, tackling a standard logistics challenge found in production and distribution.

ðŸ“œ Overview
The Vehicle Routing Problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to serve a given set of customers. This project implements a genetic algorithm to find a near-optimal solution by minimizing the total distance traveled by the fleet.

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that details the entire process, from exploring GAs with a simple maze solver to the full implementation for the VRP.
